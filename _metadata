This method is a little out of the way, but I don't think there is any reason to execute this method.\n\n^#A451C4;NOTE:^reset; I am planning on adding a way to purchase the recipes to learn how to craft, via a store or vending machine, but I'll have to test it out first.\n\nCredits:\n^#A451C4;Weaver^reset; ^#9BBA3D;https://steamcommunity.com/id/weaverthree^reset; - For the original Platform Hatches mod.\n\n^#A451C4;Github:^reset; ^#A451C4;https://github.com/thakyZ/PlatformHatchesErrorBeGone^reset;\n^#A451C4;Steam:^reset; ^#A451C4;Coming Soon*^reset;\n\nRequires Platform Hatches by Weaver\n^#A451C4;Steam:^reset; ^#9BBA3D;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753337799^reset;",
