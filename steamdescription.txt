[b]Gets rid of those nasty errors by the Platform Hatches mod.[/b]

Basically they had made a way for you to obtain knowledge of how to craft all the ship hatches, but failed to update when the ability to craft recipes was removed?
I am not sure if the ability was ever removed or they just did it wrong, but it looked correct, so I just went ahead and made a completely new way to learn how to craft the hatches/doors of the racial ship parts.
I hope you guys can find some use in this, it's not much but I do hate getting error messages in my console.

Also in order to learn the recipes, you can go either of two ways:
[olist]
[*] Place down the Hatch Hammer and you will immediately unlock the recipes.
[*] Place down any of the Hatches/Doors and you'll probably need a mod that lets you learn blueprints upon scanning them, and scan the hatch or door. This method is a little out of the way, but I don't think there is any reason to execute this method.[/olist]

[b]NOTE:[/b] I am planning on adding a way to purchase the recipes to learn how to craft, via a store or vending machine, but I'll have to test it out first.
